**What is RAE For Unity?**

RAE For Unity is Unity plugin enabling RAE robot digital twin simulation.

Main goals are:

- Digital twin of RAE (virtual RAE simulation) enabling development in virtual environment.
- Connect to real RAE using ROS integration (rae-ros and depthai-ros) with smooth transition from sim to real.
- Develop native apps from basic control to augmented reality (AR) / mixed reality (MXR).
- Publish topics from simulation and subscribe topics from real RAE for easy development.
