**What is RAE For Unity?**

RAE For Unity is Unity plugin enabling RAE robot digital twin simulation.

Main goals are:

- Digital twin of RAE (virtual RAE simulation) enabling development in virtual environment.
- Connect to real RAE using ROS integration (rae-ros and depthai-ros) with smooth transition from sim to real.
- Develop native apps from basic control to augmented reality (AR) / mixed reality (MXR).
- Unlock Unity power with third party assets
- Publish topics from simulation and subscribe topics from real RAE for easy development.

Examples coming (may use third party assets from Asset Store):
- iOS / Android Native app to control RAE including: 
  - use PS4 game controller to control RAE
  - use voice control
  - how to use all peripherals
- Augmented Reality using native iOS/Android
  - Touch and Go control
- Mixed Reality using Meta Quest 3
